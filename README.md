# Startup-Web-Sandbox

## Overview
Startup-Web-Sandbox is a web-based toolkit for startups to audit, secure, and test their web apps before production. It provides a suite of free, open-source checks and best practices.

## Features

### Easy to Use Scans
- **Security Scan & Vulnerability Check**: Checks for common vulnerabilities. For advanced scanning, integrate [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/).
- **Broken Link Checker**: Finds broken or dead links on your site.
- **Domain & DNS Information**: Shows DNS records and registrar info.
- **Social Media Metadata Validation**: Checks Open Graph and Twitter Card tags.
- **SSL Certificate Check**: Verifies SSL certificate validity and configuration.

### Advanced & Extended Scans
- **Resource Access Monitor**: Monitors resource usage and access patterns.
- **Trace Logging**: Enables detailed trace logging for debugging.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scan**: Scans npm/yarn dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **HTTP Security Headers Analysis**: Reviews HTTP headers for security best practices.
- **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection Check**: Tests for basic rate limiting and anti-DDoS measures.
- **Authentication & Authorization Review**: Checks for common auth misconfigurations.
- **Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance**: Scans for privacy policy, cookie consent, and GDPR indicators.
- **Automated Accessibility Audit**: Checks for accessibility issues (alt tags, labels, etc.).
- **Performance & Load Testing**: Runs basic load tests and reports bottlenecks.
- **Open Ports & Network Exposure Scan**: Uses [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html) to check for exposed ports/services. **Requires Nmap installed on your server.**
- **Secrets & Key Exposure Scan**: Scans for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in your codebase.
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery Validation**: Checks for backup and recovery documentation.

## Requirements & Extended Features

- **Nmap**: Required for Open Ports & Network Exposure Scan. [Install Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html)
- **OWASP ZAP**: For advanced vulnerability scanning. [Install ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
	```bash
	git clone <repo-url>
	cd Startup-Web-Sandbox
	npm install
	```
2. Start the development server:
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```
3. Open the app in your browser and enter a URL to audit.
4. Select the scans you want to run. Results will appear in expandable accordion sections.

## Adding Extended Features
- To use Open Ports scan, install Nmap on your server and ensure it is available in your system PATH.
- For advanced vulnerability scanning, install OWASP ZAP and configure the backend to use it for deeper scans.
